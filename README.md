## <a name="Course-Overview"></a>Course Overview:
```javascript
In this course, we try to teach fundamentals of digital image processing and computer vision including theories and techniques for undergraduate students. 
Not only do we attempt to cover fundamental concepts, but also we investigate basic codes in DIP. Particularly, some Python libraries such as Pillow and OpenCV are considered. 
In addition, if we have time, Digital photography is skimmed.

It is worth mentioning that we explain concepts in the first part of the class 
and practice them in the second part.
